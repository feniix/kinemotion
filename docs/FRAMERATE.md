## Executive Summary

**TL;DR:**
- **60 fps is the sweet spot** for drop jump analysis (best accuracy/cost ratio)
- **30 fps is acceptable** for most applications with sub-frame interpolation
- **120+ fps offers diminishing returns** (minimal accuracy gains, significant processing overhead)
- **Calibration matters more than frame rate** (+17% vs +2-3% accuracy improvement)

**Key Finding:** Frame rate improvements follow a **logarithmic curve** - each doubling provides progressively smaller accuracy gains.

## Frame Rate Impact on Accuracy

### Timing Precision by Frame Rate

Sub-frame interpolation (enabled by default) provides sub-millisecond timing precision:

| Frame Rate | Time Between Frames | Precision with Interpolation | Precision without Interpolation |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **30 fps** | 33.3 ms | ±10 ms | ±33 ms |
| **60 fps** | 16.7 ms | ±5 ms | ±17 ms |
| **120 fps** | 8.3 ms | ±2.5 ms | ±8 ms |
| **240 fps** | 4.2 ms | ±1.25 ms | ±4 ms |
| **480 fps** | 2.1 ms | ±0.6 ms | ±2 ms |

**How sub-frame interpolation works:**
- Calculates smooth velocity curve using Savitzky-Golay derivative
- Finds exact threshold crossing between frames using linear interpolation
- Returns fractional frame indices (e.g., 48.73 instead of 49)
- Reduces timing error by 60-70% compared to integer frame boundaries

**Math example at 30fps:**
```
Without interpolation:
- Event occurs at frame 48.7
- Detected at frame 49 (integer boundary)
- Error: 0.3 frames × 33.3ms/frame = 10ms error
- Worst case: ±33ms (full frame)

With interpolation:
- Event detected at frame 48.73 (fractional)
- Error: 0.03 frames × 33.3ms/frame = 1ms error
- Typical error: ±10ms (residual from velocity smoothness)
```

### Expected Accuracy Improvements

Assuming calibrated measurements using `--drop-height`:

| Frame Rate | Contact Time Error | Flight Time Error | Jump Height Accuracy | Improvement over 30fps |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **30 fps** | ±10-15 ms | ±10-15 ms | ~88% (baseline) | - |
| **60 fps** | ±5-8 ms | ±5-8 ms | ~90-91% | +2-3% |
| **120 fps** | ±3-5 ms | ±3-5 ms | ~91-92% | +3-4% |
| **240 fps** | ±2-3 ms | ±2-3 ms | ~92-93% | +4-5% |
| **480 fps** | ±1-2 ms | ±1-2 ms | ~92-93% | +4-5% |

**Note:** Accuracy improvements plateau beyond 120fps due to other limiting factors (tracking quality, motion blur, calibration precision).

## Temporal Resolution Analysis

### Contact Detection Reliability

Brief ground contacts benefit most from high frame rates. Minimum contact frames filter (`--min-contact-frames`) must capture enough samples to confirm contact:

**Example: 100ms ground contact (brief reactive jump)**

| Frame Rate | Frames Captured | Detection Reliability | Recommended `--min-contact-frames` |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **30 fps** | ~3 frames | ⚠️ Marginal (requires `--min-contact-frames 2-3`) | 2-3 |
| **60 fps** | ~6 frames | ✅ Reliable (default `--min-contact-frames 3` × 2) | 4-6 |
| **120 fps** | ~12 frames | ✅ Very robust | 8-12 |
| **240 fps** | ~24 frames | ✅ Excessive (overkill) | 16-24 |

**Example: 250ms ground contact (typical drop jump)**

| Frame Rate | Frames Captured | Detection Reliability | Recommended `--min-contact-frames` |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **30 fps** | ~7-8 frames | ✅ Reliable | 3-5 |
| **60 fps** | ~15 frames | ✅ Very robust | 6-10 |
| **120 fps** | ~30 frames | ✅ Excessive | 12-20 |
| **240 fps** | ~60 frames | ✅ Excessive (overkill) | 24-40 |

**Rule of thumb:** Frame rate becomes less critical as contact time increases.

### Velocity Calculation Smoothness

More temporal samples = smoother velocity derivative:

**30 fps:**
- Adequate for Savitzky-Golay smoothing (5-frame window = 167ms)
- Occasional noise spikes in velocity
- Sub-frame interpolation compensates effectively
- ✅ Acceptable for most applications

**60 fps:**
- Noticeably smoother velocity curves (5-frame window = 83ms)
- Fewer false threshold crossings
- Better acceleration pattern detection for curvature analysis
- ✅ **Recommended** for consistent results

**120 fps:**
- Very smooth velocity curves (5-frame window = 42ms)
- Minimal noise in derivatives
- Marginal improvement over 60fps in practice
- ⚠️ Diminishing returns begin

**240+ fps:**
- Extremely smooth curves but no practical benefit
- Accuracy limited by tracking quality, not sampling rate
- ❌ Processing overhead outweighs gains

### MediaPipe Tracking Quality

**Frame rate affects pose tracking in two ways:**

1. **Inter-frame motion** (lower is better):
   - 30 fps: Larger motion between frames, harder to track
   - 60 fps: Smaller motion between frames, more stable tracking
   - 120+ fps: Minimal inter-frame motion, excellent stability

2. **Processing overhead** (higher is worse):
   - 30 fps: Baseline processing time
   - 60 fps: 2× processing time (linear scaling)
   - 120 fps: 4× processing time
   - 240 fps: 8× processing time

**Tracking quality improvement is logarithmic:**
- 30→60 fps: Noticeable improvement in landmark stability
- 60→120 fps: Small improvement in stability
- 120→240 fps: Negligible improvement

  --min-contact-frames 6 \         # double (same time duration)
  --drop-height 0.40
```

**Expected accuracy:** ~90-91% with calibration (+2-3% over 30fps)

**💡 Recommendation:** If you can only choose one upgrade, **use 60fps video** - it provides the best return on investment for accuracy.

### 120 fps - Diminishing Returns 🔬

**Best for:**
- Research requiring <5ms timing precision
- Analysis of explosive/reactive movements
- High-speed biomechanics research
- Validation studies against force plates

**Advantages:**
- ✅ ±2.5ms timing precision
- ✅ Very robust brief contact detection
- ✅ Excellent velocity curve smoothness
- ✅ Captures rapid transitions accurately

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ 4× processing time vs 30fps (2× vs 60fps)
- ⚠️ Large file sizes (~2GB for 5min at 1080p)

  --velocity-threshold 0.005 \     # quarter (4× more frames)
  --min-contact-frames 12 \        # quadruple
  --drop-height 0.40
```

**Expected accuracy:** ~91-92% with calibration (+3-4% over 30fps, +1% over 60fps)

**💡 Note:** Only pursue 120fps if 60fps accuracy is insufficient for your application and you've already maximized calibration quality.

---

### 240 fps - Overkill for Drop Jumps ❌

**Best for:**
- Ultra-high-speed research (e.g., ballistic movements)
- Special applications requiring sub-2ms precision
- Validation of measurement systems

**Advantages:**
- ✅ ±1.25ms timing precision (theoretical)
- ✅ Maximum temporal resolution
- ✅ Captures finest motion details

**Limitations:**
- ❌ 8× processing time vs 30fps (4× vs 60fps)
- ❌ Massive file sizes (~4GB for 5min at 1080p)
- ❌ Only +0.5% accuracy over 120fps (imperceptible)
- ❌ Accuracy limited by other factors:
  - MediaPipe tracking precision (~5-10ms equivalent)
  - Motion blur (limits effective temporal resolution)
  - Calibration precision (drop height measurement)
  - 2D vs 3D motion assumptions
- ❌ Requires specialized high-speed cameras
- ❌ Difficult to achieve good lighting at 240fps

**Recommended parameters:**
```bash
kinemotion dropjump-analyze video_240fps.mp4 \
  --smoothing-window 5 \
  --velocity-threshold 0.0025 \    # 1/8× (8× more frames)
  --min-contact-frames 24 \        # 8×
  --drop-height 0.40
```

**Expected accuracy:** ~92-93% with calibration (+4-5% over 30fps, +1-2% over 60fps, +0.5% over 120fps)

**💡 Verdict:** Not recommended for drop jumps - other factors become limiting before frame rate at this level.

## Parameter Adjustments by Frame Rate

### Proportional Scaling Rules

When changing frame rate, adjust parameters proportionally to maintain equivalent behavior:

**Rule 1: Velocity threshold scales inversely with FPS**
```
threshold_new = threshold_30fps × (30 / fps_new)

Examples:
30 fps → 60 fps: 0.02 → 0.01 (halve)
30 fps → 120 fps: 0.02 → 0.005 (quarter)
30 fps → 240 fps: 0.02 → 0.0025 (1/8×)
```

**Explanation:** Higher FPS = less motion per frame, so lower threshold needed to detect same velocity.

**Rule 2: Minimum contact frames scales linearly with FPS**
```
min_frames_new = min_frames_30fps × (fps_new / 30)

Examples:
30 fps → 60 fps: 3 → 6 (double)
30 fps → 120 fps: 3 → 12 (quadruple)
30 fps → 240 fps: 3 → 24 (8×)
```

**Explanation:** To capture the same minimum contact time duration, need proportionally more frames.

**Rule 3: Smoothing window can stay constant (or adjust slightly)**
```
# Keep temporal duration constant
smoothing_window_new = smoothing_window_30fps × (fps_new / 30)

# OR keep frame count constant for similar smoothing
smoothing_window_new = smoothing_window_30fps

Examples (constant duration):
30 fps with window=5 → 167ms temporal window
60 fps with window=10 → 167ms temporal window (same duration)
120 fps with window=20 → 167ms temporal window (same duration)

Examples (constant frames, recommended):
30 fps with window=5 → 5 frames
60 fps with window=5 → 5 frames (less temporal duration, more samples)
120 fps with window=5 → 5 frames
```

**Recommendation:** Keep smoothing window at 5-7 frames regardless of FPS for best results.

### Complete Parameter Sets by Frame Rate

**30 fps baseline:**
```bash
kinemotion dropjump-analyze video_30fps.mp4 \
  --smoothing-window 5 \
  --polyorder 2 \
  --velocity-threshold 0.02 \
  --min-contact-frames 3 \
  --visibility-threshold 0.5 \
  --drop-height 0.40
```

**60 fps (2× frames):**
```bash
kinemotion dropjump-analyze video_60fps.mp4 \
  --smoothing-window 5 \          # same (or 10 for constant duration)
  --polyorder 2 \                 # same
  --velocity-threshold 0.01 \     # halve (2× more frames)
  --min-contact-frames 6 \        # double (2× more frames)
  --visibility-threshold 0.5 \    # same
  --drop-height 0.40
```

**120 fps (4× frames):**
```bash
kinemotion dropjump-analyze video_120fps.mp4 \
  --smoothing-window 5 \          # same (or 20 for constant duration)
  --polyorder 2 \                 # same
  --velocity-threshold 0.005 \    # quarter (4× more frames)
  --min-contact-frames 12 \       # quadruple (4× more frames)
  --visibility-threshold 0.5 \    # same
  --drop-height 0.40
```

**240 fps (8× frames):**
```bash
kinemotion dropjump-analyze video_240fps.mp4 \
  --smoothing-window 5 \          # same (or 40 for constant duration)
  --polyorder 2 \                 # same
  --velocity-threshold 0.0025 \   # 1/8× (8× more frames)
  --min-contact-frames 24 \       # 8× (8× more frames)
  --visibility-threshold 0.5 \    # same
  --drop-height 0.40
```

### Auto-Detecting Frame Rate (Future Enhancement)

Currently, you must manually specify parameters based on FPS. A future enhancement could auto-detect FPS and adjust parameters:

```python
# Pseudo-code for future feature
fps = video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
scaling_factor = fps / 30.0

velocity_threshold = 0.02 / scaling_factor
min_contact_frames = int(3 * scaling_factor)
```

## Accuracy Bottlenecks Beyond Frame Rate

At high frame rates (120+ fps), other factors become limiting:

### 1. MediaPipe Tracking Precision

**Tracking resolution:** ~1-2 pixels per landmark in 1080p video
```
Example: 1 pixel error in 1080p frame
→ 1/1080 = 0.0009 normalized units
→ ~1mm real-world error with good calibration
→ Equivalent to ~5-10ms timing error at typical jump velocities
```

**Impact:** Even with 240fps, tracking precision limits effective accuracy to ~5-10ms, making frame rate improvements beyond 60fps marginal.

### 2. Camera Motion Blur

**Exposure time creates motion blur:**
```
30 fps → typical exposure: 1/60s (16.7ms)
60 fps → typical exposure: 1/120s (8.3ms)
120 fps → typical exposure: 1/240s (4.2ms)
240 fps → typical exposure: 1/480s (2.1ms)
```

**Motion blur limits effective temporal resolution:**
- At 30fps with 1/60s exposure: landmarks "smeared" over ~1.5 frames
- At 240fps with 1/480s exposure: landmarks sharp, minimal blur
- **But:** Pose tracking already introduces ~1-2 pixel uncertainty (5-10ms)

**Conclusion:** Beyond 60fps, reduced motion blur provides minimal practical benefit given tracking limitations.

### 3. Calibration Accuracy

**Drop height measurement precision:**
```
±1cm error in 40cm drop height measurement
→ ±2.5% calibration error
→ ±2.2% jump height error (propagates)
→ Equivalent to ±8mm error on 35cm jump

Frame rate improvement from 60→240fps:
→ ~±1% timing improvement
→ ±3.5mm jump height improvement

Conclusion: Calibration accuracy dominates over frame rate
```

**Impact:** Improving drop height measurement from ±1cm to ±2mm has greater effect than upgrading from 60fps to 240fps.

### 4. Out-of-Plane Motion

**2D video captures only one plane:**
```
Athlete moves forward/backward during jump:
→ Foot appears higher/lower than actual
→ Creates systematic measurement error
→ Not improved by higher frame rate
```

**Typical error:** ±5-10mm from out-of-plane motion
**Impact:** Comparable to timing errors at 60fps; frame rate doesn't address this

### 5. Athlete Movement Variability

**Human movement is inherently variable:**
```
Typical jump-to-jump variability:
- Ground contact time: ±10-20ms
- Flight time: ±5-15ms
- Jump height: ±2-5cm

Measurement precision required:
→ ~5-10ms timing precision (met by 60fps)
→ Sub-millisecond precision unnecessary
```

**Conclusion:** Beyond 60fps, measurement precision exceeds athlete repeatability.
